                        <p>Our Project[PLACEHOLDER] was dreamt up as a student project for a course in Agile Project Management for a group of 
                            Blockchain Development students dubbed Billy Blaze Team by their teacher. Our Project[PLACEHOLDER] is built to learn how to
                            work together as a team and to grow our skills in working within the Web3 and crypto space. 
                            <br/> 
                            We decided to make a coin as it seemed like the natural step forward for our education and because we believed it would be fun 
                            . Therefore we invite all of you to take part in this small piece of history and to share in our jouney.

                        <p>As the base of this project we are using Solidity with the help of the Openzeppelin GitHub repository to construct a standard ERC20 token on the Polygon network using our skills to customize the code and apply it for our needs as specified

                            <p>We decided on Polygon as our native network due to its integration of EVM technology, allowing for Solidity contracts to be deployed to its Blockchain
                                and because of the low transaction fees and high transaction speed. We have strong faith in the Polygon network and its community. As it is so, we believe it will suit 
                                our needs and allow us to provide the first ERC20 token of our careers.

                            <p>The deployed contract for Our Project[PLACEHOLDER] was constructed in Remix using assistance from open source code provided by OpenZeppelin on GitHub to ease the process
                                for our project as we only have 2-3 weeks to complete this project. This code has been modified by our team so we can apply it to the goals set out in our Epic* (Term used in Agile)
                                We have strong faith that the code will allow us to achieve our goals.

                        <p>We are four Blockchain Development students from an unnamed University(withheld to avoid spam), we set out to create an ERC20 token as we felt it would be a logical next
                            step in our programming journey and as a portfolio building exercise. Initially we wanted to write a peer-to-peer lending system in JavaScript but that felt too much like
                            what we had been doing for the 6 months and felt ready to properly dip our toes into the Web3 spece.
                            <br/> 
                            We don't have a long lasting vision for this project and we want to be public about this to avoid confusion. This is a 3 week project that we will build, deploy and use 
                            as proof of skill in the future. Feel free to buy a few thousand coins to be able to show your friend and tell them I bougt a shit-coin from students.
