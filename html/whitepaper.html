              <p>
                Squared Finance was dreamt up as a student project for a course
                in Agile Project Management for a group of Blockchain
                Development students dubbed Billy Blaze Team by their teacher.
                Squared Finance and its token Squarium($SQR) is built to learn
                how to work together as a team and to grow our skills in working
                within the Web3 and crypto space.
                <br />
                <br />
                We decided to deploy a token as it seemed like the natural step
                forward for our education and because we believed it would be
                fun. Therefore we invite all of you to take part in this small
                piece of history and to share in this jouney.
                <br />
                <br />
                The team is available on Twitter and Discord, we will be there to hang out
                and help any answers about the project!

            <h3><button>+</button>2. Token Model and Network</h3>
            <div class="wp-textDiv">
              <p>
                As the base of this project we are using Solidity with the help
                of the Openzeppelin GitHub repository to construct a standard
                ERC20 token on the Polygon network using our skills to customize
                the code and apply it for our needs as specified the tokenomics
                section.
              </p>
              <h4>2.1 Polygon</h4>
              <div class="wp-h4p">
                <p>
                  We decided on Polygon as our native network due to its
                  integration of EVM technology, allowing for Solidity contracts
                  to be deployed to its Blockchain and because of the low
                  transaction fees and fast transaction speeds. We have strong
                  faith in the Polygon network and its community. As it is so,
                  we believe it will suit our needs and allow us to deploy the
                  first ERC20 token of our careers.
                </p>
              </div>
              <h4>2.2 Smart Contract</h4>
              <div class="wp-h4p">
                <p>
                  The deployed contract for Squarium was constructed in Remix
                  using assistance from open source code provided by
                  OpenZeppelin on GitHub to ease the process for our project as
                  we only have 2-3 weeks to complete this project. This code has
                  been modified by our team so we can apply it to the goals set
                  out in our Epic* (Term used in Agile) We have strong faith
                  that the code will allow us to achieve our goals.
                  <br />
                  The code is available publicly

            <div class="wp-textDiv">
              <p>
                The Squarium token will have a max supply of 84.000.000 units.
                25% of these will be distributed to the dev team and the
                remaining 75% will be available in a freemint to the public.
                Squariums usecase is that of a peer-to-peer lending service on
                our website (INSERT WEBSITE HERE) that may be developed and
                deployed within a week of Token launch. We will also try to list
                our tonken on Uniswap so that everyone will be able to enjoy the
                Squarium gains.

              <p>
                We are four Blockchain Development students from an unnamed
                University(withheld to avoid spam), we set out to create an
                ERC20 token as we felt it would be a logical next step in our
                programming journey and as a portfolio building exercise.
                Initially we wanted to write a peer-to-peer lending system in
                JavaScript but that felt too much like what we had been doing
                for the past 6 months. We felt ready to properly dip our toes
                into the Web3 spece so we took it upon ourselves to do what so
                many have done before us and create a ERC20 token.

                Although Squarium is a student project we hope the community will grow and support us in this journey. 
                If you want to help out we have a Discord and a Twitter where you can interact with devs and the 
                community. We are dedicated to being available to answer any and all questions you may have.

              <h4>5.1 Launch Day</h4>
              <p>
                
                We decided that friday the 13th would be an amazing day to launch the coin so we are setting up a 
                livestream and airdrop for the full minting amount. We aren't asking for anything in exchange for the coin, 
                we do this for experience and for any community members interested! 
                <br> <br>
                </p>
                <h4>5.2 Uniswap</h4>
                <p>
                
                After launch we will get the coin tradeable for MATIC on Uniswap as soon as possible so we can trade
                and exchange SQR amongst eachother. 
                <br> <br>
                </p>
                  <h4>5.3 Post Launch</h4>
                <p>
                
                For the future, we want to integrate a peer to peer lending solution and to be active in the community
                for as long as there is interest. We hope that you will all be there with us and help us in our journey in web3 and
                cryptocurrencies.
